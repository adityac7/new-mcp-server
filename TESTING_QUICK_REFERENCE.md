|---------|--------|-------------|
| Dataset info | Name only | Name + 839K rows + 1 table + âœ… metadata |

## ðŸš¨ What to Watch For

### Potential Issues:
1. **Connection errors**: MCP endpoint not responding
2. **Missing metadata**: Columns show "No description"
3. **Generic responses**: ChatGPT doesn't follow analysis guidelines
4. **JSON responses**: Data returned as JSON instead of tables
5. **No strategic insights**: Just data, no recommendations
6. **Weighting errors**: Queries don't use SUM(weights) correctly

### How to Debug:
```bash
# Check server logs
tail -f /home/ubuntu/new-mcp-server/server.log

# Check if server is running
ps aux | grep "python3.11 server.py"

# Test core functions
cd /home/ubuntu/new-mcp-server
python3.11 test_core_functions.py

# View query logs in UI

```
