**Status**: ✅ Complete - Ready for Testing

---

## 🎯 Objective

Transform the MCP server responses to deliver **PhD-level analysis** for **senior brand managers** at large companies who make strategic decisions about **media spend allocation** and **ecommerce strategy**.

---

## ✅ Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Dataset Discovery (list_available_datasets)

**Before:**
```
| ID | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | digital_insights | No description |
```

**After:**
```
# 📊 Available Datasets

Total Datasets: 1

## Overview
These datasets contain analytics data for strategic decision-making. Each dataset includes CTV, mobile, and digital platform metrics for media planning and ecommerce strategy.

| ID | Dataset Name | Records | Tables | Metadata | Description |
|:---:|---|---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| 1 | **digital_insights** | 839,077 | 1 | ✅ | The digital_insights dataset contains comprehensive information on user engagement across various applications... |

| `app_name` | varchar | Identifies the specific application being analyzed, allowing brand managers to assess performance and user engagement metrics essential for strategic media planning. |
| `weights` | double precision | Represents statistical weights applied to data points, ensuring accurate representation of population demographics and enabling precise trend analysis for informed decision-making. |
| `gender` | varchar | Indicates the gender of users, facilitating gender-specific marketing strategies and insights into consumer behavior patterns that inform ecommerce and media strategies. |
| `event_count` | integer | Quantifies the number of user interactions within the app, providing insights into engagement levels that are critical for evaluating campaign effectiveness and user retention. |

**Benefits:**
- LLMs understand what each column represents
- Business context is immediately clear
- No need to guess column meanings
- Enables smarter query generation
